# ft_printf
This Project is about creating a library that contains a function called ft_printf, which is a re-creation of the printf function.  
Read the [subject.pdf](https://github.com/Tempest989/ft_printf/blob/main/en.subject.pdf) for in-depth information about the Project.

# Makefile Utility
- `make` and `make ft_printf` will compile the ft_printf Project, as the library `libftprintf.a`.
- `make clean` will delete all the compiled `.o` files.
- `make fclean` will run `make clean` and then delete the library `libftprintf.a`
- `make re` will run the comands, `make fclean` then `make`, to delete (if possible) `libftprintf.a` and all `.o` files, then compile the library `libftprintf.a`
